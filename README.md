# FDTD-1D-demo-simulation-MATLAB
To model Maxwell's equations in a demo material, the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method was implemented in this repository. First, the finite difference approach was used to develop Maxwell's equation for a medium. These equations were then included in MATLAB. Finally, to see the results, the wave's progression was graphically monitored. Additionally, using two monitors, reflectance and transmittance were calculated.
